Given an array arr, rotate the array by one position in clockwise direction.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Output: [5, 1, 2, 3, 4]
Explanation: If we rotate arr by one position in clockwise 5 come to the front and remaining those are shifted to the end.


class Solution {
  public:
    void rotate(vector<int> &arr) {
        // code here
        reverse(arr.begin(),arr.end());
        reverse(arr.begin()+1,arr.end());
    }
};
